BLender Hexen II MDL Import/Export

# NOTE
This model exporter/importer is a direct clone of Blender MDL import/export(http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Import-Export/Quake_mdl) by QuakeForge. The only difference so far is the adaptation to the Hexen II palette and the names obviously. I hold no rights to this product.
This code is by no means of my conception and I hold no ownership of it. The fork was only made to provide an extra support for the Hexen II community for mapping and modding. All the code and functionalities are ownership of Quakeforge. Please support them!
